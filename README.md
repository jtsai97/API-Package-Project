## Final Project Proposal

Jeffray Tsai
Project Type A: Functional/API client Python package

Project Description

No one would knew that Reddit would be the site that gets people to make a huge impact on the stock market earlier in 2021. The subreddit r/wallstreebets gained attention when redditors got stocks from GameStop, AMC, Nokia, and Naked Brand Group and drove their stock prices up. However, Robinhood, a commonly used app for stocks, decided to freeze trades on January 28th 2021 when they realized that Reddit users were frantically buying stock from the said companies. In this project, we want to be able to gain knowledge on when this reaction to start buying stocks from the companies impacted started, and also what are the common phrasings used to get everyone to increase the stock prices together.
